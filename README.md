xPlodMusic-Dependencies
=======================

This repository contains the necessary libraries to be imported in Eclipse, before you can successfully compile it.

I have mirrored all the libraries, as they were updated with time and are no longer the way they should be.
Please note that all the libraries used in this project are under APACHE v2 license, and provide proper permissions to be distributed as required, with or without any modifications.

Libraries : 

1. AndroidSlidingUpPanel - Thanks to umano, original repo here : https://github.com/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel
2. drag-sort-listview - Thanks to bauerca, original repo here : https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview
3. library(it is actually NineOldAndroids) - Thanks to JakeWharton, original repo here : https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids

If you face any problems, please comment them out at http://c-aniruddh.us.to/xplodmusic-awesomeness-redefined-a-music-player-for-android/ or mail them to me at aniruddh.chandratre@gmail.com
